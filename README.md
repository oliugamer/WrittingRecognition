# Writting Recognition

*The web app part is WIP :)*

This is a web app that uses a neural network made with tensorflow to recognise handwritten capital letters. 

This project is divided in two, the upyter notebook and the web app itself.

Code specifications: 
- You will need the following libraries, mostly for the notebook:
    - pillow
    - numpy
    - glob
    - matplotlib
    - tensorflow
    - sklearn (if you want to execute the PCA part)
- The images for training can be found in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sankalpsrivastava26/capital-alphabets-28x28?select=datasetSmall
